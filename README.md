# task-organizer
We are creating a skills organizer. This purpose of this application is to keep track of our skills that require constant sharpening.


When we have a variety of hobbies, and don't specifically track the progress of each, we will eventually forget about some, and our
skills in that area will decay, and if left unattended for long enough, we will have to rebuild knowledge/skill in that field. While
 re-learning is always easier than learning for the first time, it is usually unnessesary to do so. By tracking each individual hobby,
you are able to at least be aware of skills that have not been touched in a while - that is, the ones you have written down.


In this application, there will be a series of graphical progress bars, each to represent the 'freshness' of a skillset,
to track a number of skillsets you intend to keep track of. The bars will decay in length over time, and you could add points 
to lengthen a bar every time you have worked in a specific field. This will enable a visual representation of the abilities you have, and
if used properly, that is, checked twice a day, can keep ALL of your skills fresh and will prevent further time wasted by having to
re-learn anything.


But first, we must write down an analysis of what hobbies matter to me and are worth tracking. The names of the hobbies must also be
somewhat generalized, but not too broad to the extent where some fields are misrepresented.
